This project is intended for secondary school teachers in Spain.
It tries to help teachers to process a lot of information about students
and their progress.

It is meant to follow some legal requirements only found in the spanish 
educational sytem.

It is developed in English. Until now it is translated only to standard
spanish, but it can be easily extended to all languages from Spain.
